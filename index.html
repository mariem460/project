                ReDI School is a non-profit tech school for women with migrant- and refugee background, offering a free program, 
                including IT and tech courses on several levels. 
                Our focus is <strong>to create digital empowerment by supporting women in getting access to digital skills and a social and professional network in Denmark.</strong>
                We also work for more diversity and inclusion in the Danish labor market - and especially in the IT field.
                ReDI School was in Copenhagen in the fall 2019 which was made possible by The Coca-Cola Foundation. 
                In January 2020 we received a donation from <strong>The VELUX</strong> Foundation for adapting and developing our program further to make the biggest possible impact.
                We collaborate with partners from both the business sector, public sector and NGO's - <strong>and most importantly a group of dedicated volunteer teachers and mentors.</strong>
                Together we set out to provide our students with new opportunities by supporting them 
                in improving their digital skills and soft skills, as well helping them create contact to potential employers.
